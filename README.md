#  ORA's Treat Recipe Finder

ORA's Treat Recipe Finder is a simple recipe application that allows users to search for meals and build a grocery list for meal planning.  
The app fetches recipes from the **[TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/)** and displays results with meal details.  
Although some advanced features are still in development, the app already provides a smooth experience for exploring recipes.
